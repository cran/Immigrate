# Immigrate
This project is the R code version for IMMIGRATE algorithm(${\bf I}$terative $\bf{M}$ax-$\bf{MI}$n entropy mar$\bf{G}$in-maximization with inte$\bf{RA}$ction $\bf{TE}$rms algorithm, IMMIGRATE, henceforth).

IMMIGRATE is a hypothesis-margin based feature selection method with interaction terms. For more details, please refer to the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02658.pdf). 

Based on large hypothesis-margin principle, this package performs feature selection methods: 

`"IM4E"`(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); 

`"Immigrate"`(Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms Algorithm); 

`"BIM"`(Booster version of IMMIGRATE);

`"Simba"`(Iterative Search Margin Based Algorithm); 

`"LFE"`(Local Feature Extraction Algorithm). 

This package also performs prediction for the above feature selection methods.
