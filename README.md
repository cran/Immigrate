# Immigrate
IMMIGRATE: a feature selection method with interaction terms

Based on large margin principle, this package performs feature selection methods: 

`"IM4E"`(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); 

`"imIM4E"`(imbalance Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); 

`"Immigrate"`(Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms Algorithm); 

`"BIM"`(Booster version of IMMIGRATE);

`"Simba"`(Iterative Search Margin Based Algorithm); 

`"LFE"`(Local Feature Extraction Algorithm). 

This package also performs prediction for the above feature selection methods.
